.TH "SIMPLE_SHELL" 1 "16 September 2020" "General Command Manual"
.SH NAME
.B Simple_shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "holberton.h"
.TP
.B ./hsh -> executes
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fbSimple_Shell\fr is a program that provides an interface for users to get access to the kernel services, using two modes:
.TP
.B Interactive Mode
.TP
Shell takes the command from the standard input, excutes and reads another command line.
.TP
.B Non-interactive Mode
.TP
Reads commands from a file sent through a pipe, the commnads will be executed the shell stops askin for more
.TP
Simple_shell is fully written un C programming lanaguage using system calls that are regular C functions
.SH ARGUMENTS
No support for Arguments
.SH INVOCATION
In order to invoke this shell it is necessary to run \fb./hsh\fr command.
.SH DEFINITIONS
The following definitions are used throughout the rest of this document
.TP
.B blank
.TP
A space or a tab
.TP
.B Word
.TP
A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell. Also known as a token. They will be accessed by the strtok C function.
.TP
.B name
.TP
a word consisting only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, and beginning with an alpahabetic character or an underscore/identifier
.SH SHELL GRAMMAR
A \fB simple command\fR is a sequence of optional variable assingments followed by blank seperated words and redirection and terminated by a control operator. CTRL + D or the -1 Return of a function.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.TP
The return value of a \fBsimple command\fR is its exit status, for this particular Shell, the signal CTRL + D has been supressed.
.SH VARIABLES	
.TP
The next variables are set by Simple_shell.
.TP
.B OLDPWD
.TP
The previous working directory as set bt the \fB cd\fR command.
.TP
.B PWD
.TP
The current work directory
.TP
.B PATH
.TP
The search path for commands. It is a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands (see COMMAND EXECUTION below). A zero-length (null) directory name in the value of PATH indicates the current directory. A null directory name may appear as two adjacent colons, or as an initial or trailing colon. The default path is system-dependent, and is set by the administrator who installs bash. A common value is ''/usr/gnu/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin''.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken.

If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it. If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is invoked. If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If a match is found, that builtin is invoked.

If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no slashes, the Simple_shell searches each element of the PATH for a directory containing an executable file by that name

.SH ENVIROMENT
When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the \fB environment\fR. This is a list of \fB name-value pairs\fR, of the form \fB name=value.\fR

.SH EXAMPLE

.RS
.BR PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of an executed command  is  the value returned by the waitpid system call  or  equivalent function. Exit statuses fall between  0  and  255,though,as explained  below, the shell may use values above 125  specially.

Under certain circumstances, the shell will use special  values  to  indicate specific failure modes.

For the Simple_shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded.
If  a  command  is  not  found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127.

Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (true) if successful, and non-zero(false) if an  error occurred  while execution.

Simple_shell itself returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax  error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-zero value.   See  also the exit builtin command below.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
[\fBcommand\fP] [\fIarguments\fP]
.RS
.IP "\fBcd\fP [\fIdir\fP]"
\- Change the current directory to \fIdir\fP.  if dir is not given, the Simple_shell will take the value of the HOME environ-value as default. Given "-", the Shell will go to the OLDPWD address into the enviroment.
.IP "\fBexit\fP [\fIstatus\fP]"
\- The Simple_shell will exit with a status of \fIstatus\fP.  If no status is given, the exit status is that of the last command executed.
.IP "\fBenv\fP"
\- Displays all the environmental variables.
.RE
.SH SIGNALS
The SIG_INT (CTRL+D) signal is omitted for the Simple_shell, is it not possible to end the process through it.
